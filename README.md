## System Design

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/system_design.png" alt="NOVA System" width="500">
</p>


The system operates with two main functionalities: **start/reset** and **initialization**. Users can either start fresh, reset the system, or directly interact with specific environmental parameters.

- **Reset Button**: Allows users to re-select the environmental parameter (CO2, temperature, or humidity) that the lighting system reflects.
- **Initialization**: Computes baseline values by collecting multiple environmental data points. Thresholds are automatically set based on these baselines.

---

**Thresholds Configuration:**

1. **CO2**:
   - Maximum Threshold: `init CO2 + 5000`
   - Minimum Threshold: Not applied (aligns with "Calm Technology" principles).

2. **Temperature**:
   - Range: `init temp - 15` to `init temp + 15`

3. **Humidity**:
   - Range: `init humid - 40` to `init humid + 40`

> **Manual Adjustment**: Users can fine-tune thresholds for more precise control.

---

**Data Visualization:**

1. **LCD Demonstration**:
   - Displays:
     - Processed data
     - Initialization results
     - Selected environmental parameters in real-time

2. **LED Logic**:
   - Dynamically changes LED colors to represent environmental data within defined ranges:
     - **Blue**: Indicates the lower range
     - **Green â†’ Yellow**: Transition through mid-range values
     - **Red**: Indicates the upper limit



## 3D Modeling

### **Enclosure Design**
The 3D modeling design is inspired by the simple and recognizable lamp style from "Minecraft," bringing a touch of its blocky charm into the real world.

## Building Process

### **Development Workflow**
NOVA operates with the following workflow:
1. **Hardware Configuration**: Integration of sensors and actuators.
2. **Firmware Design**: Coordination of data collection and alert mechanisms.
3. **Enclosure Design**: Building a robust and aesthetically pleasing housing.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/workflow.png" alt="NOVA Workflow" width="500">
</p>

The project workflow begins with **hardware preparation**, including tasks such as soldering components, designing and testing circuits, and running iterative experiments to ensure the system's reliability. The hardware design phase provides a foundation for the **firmware design**, where functionality is defined and implemented.

A strong interaction between **code design** and **hardware design** drives the iterative processâ€”code refactoring often requires hardware adjustments, while hardware updates demand changes in the firmware to align with new parameters or constraints. This feedback loop ensures seamless integration between the system's physical and logical components.

The **3D modeling phase**, which involved designing the enclosure to house the system, proved more time-consuming than initially anticipated due to the challenges of balancing aesthetics, functionality, and structural durability. The finalized model was then fabricated to complete the enclosure design. 

This iterative and collaborative process ultimately brought the project from concept to completion.

## Reflection

### Development Challenges
- Integrating multiple sensors while ensuring accurate data synchronization.
- Balancing visual comfort with energy efficiency in LED alerts.

### Observations on Sensing Limitations
- Environmental variables (like light intensity) can interfere with CO2 sensor readings.

### Unintended Consequences
- Users reported enhanced focus but occasionally relied on NOVA more than intended.

### Negative Consequences
- Prolonged exposure to LED lighting may cause mild eye strain in low-light conditions.
